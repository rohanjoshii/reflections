When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository because then you can collaborate on it with many
other people and it is very easy to transfer files and changes to the master branch of a project to and from the remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to manually pull changes because at certain states during your work, if someone had edited the same document as you were and GitHub automatically updated the file that you were working on, that could negatively effect your work
